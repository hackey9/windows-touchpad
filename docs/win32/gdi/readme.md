# Windows GDI

## Purpose

The Microsoft Windows graphics device interface (GDI) enables applications to use graphics and formatted text on both the video display and the printer. Windows-based applications do not access the graphics hardware directly. Instead, GDI interacts with device drivers on behalf of applications.

## Where applicable

GDI can be used in all Windows-based applications.

## Developer audience

This API is designed for use by C/C++ programmers. Familiarity with the Windows message-driven architecture is required.

## Run-time requirements

For information in which operating systems are required to use a particular function, see the Requirements section of the documentation for the function.
