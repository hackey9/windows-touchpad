# Module 3. Windows Graphics

Module 1 of this series showed how to create a blank window. Module 2 took a slight detour through the Component Object Model (COM), which is the foundation for many of the modern Windows APIs. Now it is time to add graphics to the blank window that we created in Module 1.

This module starts with a high-level overview of the Windows graphics architecture. We then look at Direct2D, a powerful graphics API that was introduced in Windows 7.
